          <p>
            In recent years, healthcare has undergone a massive transformation.
            The rise of online video consultations has given patients faster
            access to doctors, without the need to travel long distances or sit
            in crowded waiting rooms. What was once considered an option has now
            become a necessity.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Online Consultations?</h2>
          <p>
            Online consultations provide convenience, accessibility, and safety.
            Patients can connect with doctors from the comfort of their homes,
            reducing the risk of exposure to contagious illnesses. For rural
            areas, this means life-saving access to specialists that were once
            out of reach.
